# Phone Numbers kata

**Problem statement.**
Write a program that validates telephone numbers

A valid telephone number:
* Must start with a '0'
* Is 11 digits in length - no more, no less
* Users may use spaces, hyphens, parentheses or commas when providing a number
    * These characters are to be discarded. Thus given e.g. "0 (608) 555-1212" as input, the function you are to define must return "06085551212". 

For this first implementation of a solution, for a number which does not meet the conditions of validity, "invalid" is to be returned.
