# Coding katas
This repository contains a number of coding katas. Some of the katas may differ slightly from the ones you may be familiar with, this is because some of them have been changed slightly to gear them more toward an SDET or QA mindset - i.e. mars rover kata purposely leaves some details quite vague in the hope to spark conversations between the candiate and the interviewer.
